# Hi, I'm Nirmal Kumar

## About Me

I'm an embedded systems and hardware engineer focused on solving real-world problems using efficient circuit design, embedded C, and signal processing. I specialize in building robust hardware-software systems from scratch â€” from schematics to firmware â€” with a keen eye on reliability, power efficiency, and real-time performance.

### Areas of Interest

* Embedded systems (bare-metal + RTOS)
* Custom hardware design (analog/digital)
* Power management & battery systems
* Real-time data acquisition and control
* Signal processing applications on microcontrollers

## Technical Skills

**Hardware & Tools**

* STM32, ESP32, KiCad, ADC/DAC
* Protocols: UART, I2C, SPI, I2S ,CAN
* Battery management circuits, voltage monitoring, low-power design

**Programming & Tools**

* Embedded C, FreeRTOS, Python (for scripting/debug), MATLAB
* STM32CubeIDE, STM32 HAL/LL drivers, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes

## Selected Projects

* **Battery Health Monitoring System:** Designed and built a coin cell discharge monitor with ADC sampling, SD card CSV logging, and low-voltage detection â€” all under FreeRTOS.
* [**Signal Processing Projects:**](https://github.com/spnirmal/Washing-Machine-FSM) Implemented real-time signal capture and analysis pipelines using microcontrollers.
* **Custom Circuits:** Developed cell balancing circuits and control systems using discrete components and custom PCBs.

*Each project has a dedicated README for in-depth details.*
