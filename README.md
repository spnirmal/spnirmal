# Hi, I'm Nirmal Kumar

## About Me
I am currently working on digital design, embedded systems, and signal processing. My work focuses on FPGA-based systems, Verilog HDL, and real-time computing applications. I am especially interested in building efficient and hardware-accelerated solutions for signal processing and embedded control.

### Areas of Interest
- FPGA and Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Real-time system design
- Custom hardware projects (e.g., guitar pedal using FPGA)
- Computer architecture and low-level design

## Technical Skills

**Hardware Platforms**
- FPGA: Tang Nano 9k, ESP32
- Interfaces: I2S, I2C, SPI, UART, SRAM, ADC/DAC

**Programming & Scripting Languages**
- Verilog, SystemVerilog, C, Assembly (MIPS), MATLAB

**Design & Simulation Tools**
- Icarus Verilog (iverilog), GTKWave, ModelSim, Vivado, KiCad, Cadence Virtuoso

## Featured Projects

### MIPS 5-Stage Pipelined Processor
Designed and simulated a MIPS processor with a 5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write Back). Demonstrates instruction flow, data path control, and register operations.

### Verilog-Based Washing Machine Controller (FSM)
Developed a finite state machine (FSM) in Verilog to simulate the control logic of a washing machine. The project includes state transitions for filling, washing, rinsing, and spinning.
